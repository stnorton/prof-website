My research uses computational social science techniques to investigate complex phenomena, with 
a particular focus on authoritarian states. My disseration uses Bayesian semi-parametrics, neural networks, time series models, 
images as data, and survey experiments to examine the challenges of authoritarian urban governance, 
the relationship between changes in state decentralization and patterns of protest,
and authoritarian manipulation of social media.

Additionally, I am working on projects on the relationship between protest and opposition voting under 
authoritarianism and characterizing the online networks of Russian alternative media readers.
