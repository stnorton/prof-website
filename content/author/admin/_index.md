My research uses computational social science techniques to investigate the complexity of 
protest and electoral behavior under authoritarianiasm, particularly in post-Soviet 
Eurasia. My disseration uses Bayesian semi-parametrics, neural networks, spatial models, 
and images as data to examine the challenges of authoritarian urban governance, the 
use of images as a visual language of mobilization across different social movements, 
and the relationship between decentralization and patterns of protest.

Additionally, I am working on projects on the relationship between protest and opposition voting under 
authoritarianism, characterizing the online networks of Russian alternative media readers, 
and the Russian state's use of disinformation on social media.
