I use computational social science to examine the phenomena that emerge when complex social processes and networks interact with the state, with a particular focus on authoritarian regimes. My dissertation includes papers on how authoritarians try and fail to pacify their large cities, the relationship between state decentralization and patterns of protest, and the Russian state's attempt to control Twitter conversations surrounding the Crimean crisis. Methodologically, I use Bayesian semi-parametric models, natural language processing techniques, and time series models. I am passionate about not only keeping up with the latest advances in machine learning and Bayesian modeling, but teaching these techniques to graduate and undergraduate students. 

I am on the academic job market looking for jobs beginning Summer to Fall 2022, but I would be happy to hear about any and all opportunities that allow me to leverage my research skills!
