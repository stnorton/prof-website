*(with Kaitlin Alpers)*

The history of democratizing Europe is one of centralization: both of the state,
 and the tactics, goals, and organizations that contest it. However, in the past two
 decades, a remarkable trend of decentralization has occured throughout the developing world.
 We investigate whether contentious politics has followed this trend of devolution, 
 contesting power where it is found rather than where it was. Using a hierarchical infinite
 hidden Markov model that accounts for sequential depnedence and the nested characteristics of the data, 
 we aim to determine if increases in regional power in developed countries leads regional factors, 
 rather than national factors, to drive protest.
