*(with Kaitlin Alper)*

The history of European democratization is one of centralization, both of the state itself
and the groups that contest it. As Europe centralized and democratized, practicioners of contentious politics 
increasingly unified into national organizations using homogenous tactics making claims on national governments.
However, in recent years developed democracies have notably decentralized. Using automatically generated event 
data and a hierarchical infinite hidden Markov model, we aim to determine whether protest dynamics have responded 
to this wave of decentraliation. Specifically, we investigate whether changes in regional authority leads regional
rather than national factors to drive regional protest rates in most developed democracies from 2000-2018.

This project is in process; further updates will be posted here. Code for the iHMM will 
be made available on my GitHub.
