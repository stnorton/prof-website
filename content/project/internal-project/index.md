A growing literature on post-communist states suggests that urban electoral and contentious dynamics are key for understanding regime trajectories and ruling party strength. While considerable research exists analyzing subnational politics in post-communist countries and its relation to national politics, our understanding of what drives patterns of political competition and contention at the municipal level remains thin. This lack of knowledge is problematic; while we may know that urban politics often precede important national-level contentious outbursts or electoral shifts, we know little about how citizens and government behave and interact at this level. This paper exploits data on Moscowâ€™s most recent municipal council elections and a large, highly-salient housing program to examine the determinants of political support at Russia's lowest level of governance: the municipal formation. the Moscow opposition seized this housing project as a campaign issue in 2017, resulting in a significantly increased opposition vote percentage and outright opposition control of many municipal formation councils. Using a hierarchical infinite mixture model, I demonstrate the housing program created complex spatial patterns of support and resistance to authoritarian rule in Moscow. Using this evidence, I argue that it is not simply the existence of large cities that threatens authoritarian survival, but the intersection of social complexity and space. This heterogeneity renders urban areas particularly illegible to authoritarian leaders, creating the possibility for serious blunders and unintended consequences, potentially with regime-threatening results.
