The presence of large cities increases the probability of authoritarian breakdown, but
the literature has offered little empirical insight as to why cities are dangerous beyond
noting the concentration of protest in urban areas. I develop a theory of cities as
complex socio-political spaces that are difficult to govern, particularly in the absence of
democratic institutions. This complexity makes both cooptation and coercion difficult,
meaning the very tactics that authoritarian cities use to control discontent can become
its proximate cause. Using a large, city-financed housing project in Moscow targeted at
rewarding regime supporters, I utilize a Bayesian semi-parametric model to demonstrate
that even a seemingly well-targeted clientelistic exchange contributed to a surprising
defeat for the regime in a subsequent municipal election. My results suggest that
treating cities as simple agglomerations distinct from rural areas obscures important
dynamics in the development of opposition to authoritarian rule.
