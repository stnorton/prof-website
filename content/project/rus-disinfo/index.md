Despite the fact that authoritarian states' use of disinformation has become an important topic in the years following the 2016 election, most existing literature focuses on disinformation as a tool of foreign policy rather than domestic policy. Using a domestically-focused Russian Twitter disinformation campaign surrounding the Ukraine Crisis, I demonstrate how the Russian regime used Twitter as a unique prong in a multi-media mobilizational campaign. The Russian Twitter campaign worked in concert with both TV and print media to react to current events, advance a state-sponsored narrative, and attempt to create the illusion of broad grassroots support for the regime-preferred interpretation of events. This reflects both Russia's regime type and past strategies for mobilizing supporters and confronting the opposition; in contrast to closed authoritarian regimes like China, Russia has a much more open political environment and lacks extensive control over the internet. As such, the Russian regime must actively compete with the opposition for control of the streets, the ballot box, and social media. The close relationship between Russia's regime type and its disinformation tactics suggests the need for further comparative research on domestic misinformation in authoritarian states.
